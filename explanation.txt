I'll scan the provided code files for the loan CRUD system built with the LavaLust framework, focusing on their database interactions, ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) approach, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. Below, I’ll concisely explain each file’s role in these aspects, keeping it clear and understandable, and focusing only on parts related to the database, ORM, and CRUD operations.

### Overview of Files
The loan CRUD system consists of:
- `app/config/database.php`: Configures database connection settings.
- `app/config/routes.php`: Defines routes for CRUD operations.
- `app/models/Loan_Model.php`: Handles database interactions using a simple ORM approach.
- `app/controllers/Loan_Controller.php`: Manages CRUD logic and form validation.
- `app/views/index.php`: Displays the CRUD interface and handles form submissions.

### File-by-File Explanation

#### 1. `app/config/database.php`
**Function (Database-Related)**:
- **Purpose**: Configures the database connection for the application.
- **Details**:
  - Specifies the `default` connection group with settings for a MySQL database:
    - `hostname: localhost`, `username: root`, `password: ''`, `database: loan_system`, `dbdriver: mysqli`, `port: 3306`.
    - Uses `utf8mb4` charset and `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` collation for Unicode support.
    - Enables Active Record (`$active_record = TRUE`), which supports the ORM-like query builder used in `Loan_Model`.
  - Provides connection details for the `loans` table used in CRUD operations.
- **ORM Role**: Sets up the database driver (`mysqli`) and enables Active Record, allowing `Loan_Model` to use query builder methods like `$this->db->table()->get_all()`.

#### 2. `app/config/routes.php`
**Function (CRUD-Related)**:
- **Purpose**: Maps URLs to controller methods for CRUD operations.
- **Details**:
  - Defines routes:
    - `GET /`: Calls `Loan_Controller::read` to display all loans (Read).
    - `POST /create-loan`: Calls `Loan_Controller::createLoan` to add a new loan (Create).
    - `POST /update-loan/{id}`: Calls `Loan_Controller::updateLoan` to update a loan (Update).
    - `POST /delete-loan/{id}`: Calls `Loan_Controller::deleteLoan` to delete a loan (Delete).
- **ORM Role**: No direct ORM interaction, but routes ensure CRUD requests reach the controller, which uses the model for database operations.

#### 3. `app/models/Loan_Model.php`
**Function (Database, ORM, CRUD-Related)**:
- **Purpose**: Manages database interactions for the `loans` table using a simple ORM approach.
- **Details**:
  - Extends `Model` class, leveraging LavaLust’s query builder for ORM-like functionality.
  - Defines table (`loans`), primary key (`id`), and fillable fields (`borrower_name`, `loan_amount`, `interest_rate`, `created_at`, `updated_at`).
  - **CRUD Methods**:
    - `getAll()`: Retrieves all loans with `SELECT * FROM loans` (`$this->db->table($this->table)->get_all()`).
    - `createLoan($data)`: Inserts a new loan record with `$this->db->table($this->table)->insert($data)`.
    - `updateLoan($id, $data)`: Updates a loan record by ID with `$this->db->table($this->table)->where('id', $id)->update($data)`.
    - `deleteLoan($id)`: Deletes a loan by ID with `$this->db->table($this->table)->where('id', $id)->delete()`.
- **ORM Approach**:
  - Uses LavaLust’s query builder (`$this->db->table`) for database operations, abstracting raw SQL.
  - The `Model` class provides methods like `get_all`, `insert`, `update`, and `delete`, which map to SQL queries.
  - The `fillable` property ensures only specified fields are used in mass assignment, enhancing security.
  - No complex ORM features (e.g., relationships or eager loading); it’s a lightweight query builder approach.

#### 4. `app/controllers/Loan_Controller.php`
**Function (Database, ORM, CRUD-Related)**:
- **Purpose**: Handles HTTP requests, validates input, and calls `Loan_Model` for CRUD operations.
- **Details**:
  - Loads `Loan_Model` and `form_validation` library in the constructor.
  - **CRUD Methods**:
    - `read()`: Fetches all loans via `$this->Loan_Model->getAll()` and passes data to the view for display (Read).
    - `createLoan()`: Validates form input (`borrower_name`, `loan_amount`, `interest_rate`) using rules like `required`, `max_length(50)`, `numeric`, `greater_than(0)`, etc. If valid, inserts a new loan via `$this->Loan_Model->createLoan` with sanitized `$_POST` data (Create).
    - `updateLoan($id)`: Validates input similarly, then updates the loan via `$this->Loan_Model->updateLoan($id, $data)` (Update).
    - `deleteLoan($id)`: Deletes a loan via `$this->Loan_Model->deleteLoan($id)` (Delete).
  - Uses `setErrors` and `setMessage` (assumed framework helpers) to handle validation errors and success messages.
  - Sanitizes `$_POST` data with `filter_var` for security.
- **ORM Role**:
  - Acts as the intermediary between the view and model, passing validated data to `Loan_Model` methods.
  - Relies on the model’s ORM methods to perform database operations without writing raw SQL.
  - Validation ensures data integrity before database interaction.

#### 5. `app/views/index.php`
**Function (CRUD-Related)**:
- **Purpose**: Provides the user interface for CRUD operations, displaying loans and forms for creating/updating/deleting.
- **Details**:
  - **Read**: Displays a table of loans fetched from `Loan_Model::getAll`, with columns for `borrower_name`, `loan_amount`, `interest_rate`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.
  - **Create**: Includes an “Add Loan” modal with a form (`action="/create-loan"`, `method="POST"`) for submitting `borrower_name`, `loan_amount`, and `interest_rate`.
  - **Update**: Each loan row has an “Edit” modal with a form (`action="/update-loan/{id}"`, `method="POST"`) pre-filled with existing loan data.
  - **Delete**: Each loan row has a “Delete” modal with a form (`action="/delete-loan/{id}"`, `method="POST"`) to confirm deletion.
  - Uses `htmlspecialchars` to prevent XSS when displaying database data.
- **ORM Role**: No direct ORM interaction; it receives data from `Loan_Controller::read` (via `Loan_Model::getAll`) and sends form data to the controller for processing.

### Database Schema (Reference)
The `loans` table, assumed to be in the `loan_system` database, supports the CRUD operations:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE loan_system;
USE loan_system;
CREATE TABLE loans (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    borrower_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    loan_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    interest_rate DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
    updated_at DATETIME NOT NULL
);
```

### How ORM Works in This System
- **Lightweight Query Builder**: LavaLust’s ORM is a simple query builder, not a full-fledged ORM like Eloquent (Laravel). It uses Active Record-like methods (`get_all`, `insert`, `update`, `delete`) to abstract SQL queries.
- **Model Interaction**: `Loan_Model` extends `Model`, which provides database access via `$this->db`. The `table` and `fillable` properties define the table and allowed fields, ensuring secure mass assignment.
- **CRUD Mapping**:
  - **Create**: `insert` method maps to `INSERT INTO loans (...) VALUES (...)`.
  - **Read**: `get_all` maps to `SELECT * FROM loans`.
  - **Update**: `where('id', $id)->update` maps to `UPDATE loans SET ... WHERE id = ?`.
  - **Delete**: `where('id', $id)->delete` maps to `DELETE FROM loans WHERE id = ?`.
- **Security**: The `fillable` array prevents unwanted fields from being inserted/updated, and `filter_var` in the controller sanitizes input.

### How Files Work Together for CRUD
1. **Database Connection** (`database.php`): Establishes the MySQL connection to `loan_system` database, enabling `Loan_Model` to interact with the `loans` table.
2. **Routing** (`routes.php`): Directs HTTP requests to the appropriate `Loan_Controller` methods for CRUD operations.
3. **Model** (`Loan_Model.php`): Provides ORM methods to perform database queries for CRUD, abstracting SQL and ensuring secure data handling.
4. **Controller** (`Loan_Controller.php`): Validates user input, calls `Loan_Model` methods for database operations, and redirects with success/error messages.
5. **View** (`index.php`): Displays loan data and provides forms for user input, sending data to the controller for processing.

### Summary
- **Database**: Configured in `database.php` to connect to `loan_system` with the `loans` table.
- **ORM**: `Loan_Model` uses a simple query builder for CRUD operations, abstracting SQL with methods like `get_all`, `insert`, `update`, and `delete`.
- **CRUD**:
  - **Create**: Form in `index.php` submits to `createLoan`, validated, and inserted via `Loan_Model::createLoan`.
  - **Read**: `Loan_Controller::read` fetches data via `Loan_Model::getAll` for display in `index.php`.
  - **Update**: Edit form in `index.php` submits to `updateLoan`, validated, and updated via `Loan_Model::updateLoan`.
  - **Delete**: Delete form in `index.php` submits to `deleteLoan`, processed via `Loan_Model::deleteLoan`.
- Each file plays a specific role, with `Loan_Model` handling database queries, `Loan_Controller` managing logic, and `index.php` providing the UI, all coordinated by `routes.php` and `database.php`.

Explanation of the Codebase
This is a PHP MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework called LavaLust, built on top of PDO for database interactions. It follows a lightweight, modular architecture with core components in the scheme/ directory and application-specific code in app/.

1. How the Database Works
Configuration: Database settings are defined in app/config/database.php, including host, username, password, database name, and driver (supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server).
Connection: The scheme/database/Database.php class establishes a PDO connection using the config. It uses prepared statements and bound parameters for security against SQL injection.
Query Building: Acts as a query builder with fluent methods for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, JOINs, WHERE clauses, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING, LIMIT, OFFSET, etc.
Execution: Methods like exec(), get(), get_all() handle query execution and return results. Supports transactions with transaction(), commit(), rollback().
Advanced Features: Bulk insert/update, raw queries, pagination support, and driver-specific optimizations.
2. Controllers
Base Class: scheme/kernel/Controller.php provides the foundation. It loads classes dynamically via $this->call and has a before_action() hook.
Functionality: Controllers handle requests, load models/libraries/helpers, process data, and render views.
Example (app/controllers/Loan_Controller.php):
Extends Controller.
Loads Loan_Model and form_validation library.
Methods: read() (fetches loans, passes to view), createLoan() (validates input, sanitizes, inserts), updateLoan(), deleteLoan().
Uses form validation for required fields, numeric checks, length limits.
Sanitizes inputs with filter_var() and redirects with flash messages.
3. Views
Purpose: Templates for rendering HTML output.
Example (app/views/index.php):
Bootstrap-styled page for loan management.
Displays loans in a table with columns for borrower name, amount, interest rate, timestamps.
Includes search input, add/edit/delete modals with forms.
Client-side JavaScript handles pagination (rows per page: 6), search filtering, and modal interactions.
Uses PHP to loop through $loans data and output rows.
4. Models
Base Class: scheme/kernel/Model.php provides ORM functionality.
Properties: $table (table name), $primary_key, $fillable (mass-assignable fields), soft delete support.
Methods: find(), all(), insert(), update(), delete(), paginate(), filter(), order_by(), etc.
Relationships: has_many(), has_one(), belongs_to(), many_to_many() for ORM relationships.
Example (app/models/Loan_Model.php):
Extends Model, sets $table = 'loans', $primary_key = 'id', $fillable array.
Methods: getAll() (select all), createLoan() (insert), updateLoan(), deleteLoan().
Uses $this->db (Database instance) for queries.
5. Search Functions
In Database Class: where(), or_where(), like(), not_like(), in(), not_in(), between(), etc., for building WHERE clauses.
In Model: filter() method applies WHERE conditions.
In View: Client-side search via JavaScript: filters table rows by borrower name (case-insensitive).
6. ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
Implementation: The Model class maps database tables to PHP objects.
Features: Automatic query building, fillable attributes for security, relationships, soft deletes, transactions.
Usage: Models extend Model, define table/primary key, use methods like $model->find($id), $model->insert($data).
7. Pagination
Library: scheme/libraries/Pagination.php generates pagination HTML.
Features: Supports themes (Bootstrap, Tailwind, custom), customizable links (First, Previous, Next, Last).
Usage: Initialize with total rows, rows per page, current page, base URL. Generates page links array and HTML.
In Model: paginate() method returns paginated data with metadata (total, per_page, current_page, last_page).
In View: JavaScript implements client-side pagination for the table, limiting display to 6 rows per page with navigation buttons.
This framework provides a solid foundation for building web applications with clean separation of concerns, security features, and extensible components.
